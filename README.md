# RollOfTheDice
Playing with SpriteKit and creating a simple 2D game with the theme "Roll of the dice". 

Below are my notes going from just the theme to a more fleshed out game idea.

## Design Notes
I want to generate some other ideas around the main theme. First, I am going to just write out some of the first associations that come to mind from the theme.

"Roll of the dice" associations:
- Board games
- Gambling
- The sound of dice hitting
- Random numbers
- Dungeons & Dragons

How are dice typically used in games?
- In board games as RNG Int input for determining amount of moves in your turn.
- RPGs use the concept of a dice roll in the same way.

## Initial Ideas

Turn-Based Games:
- Some kind of turn based game where dice are used for a different aspect of gameplay. Maybe the world has tiles that are dice faces and on each roll the player can only go to tiles that match the value rolled.
- Boggle but with dice faces. Finding max points using the numerical values and some kind of Boggle like ruleset. *
- Same as above but with scabble.
- A Platformer that is based on dice rolls. Movements determined by rolls or something - could be funny and a little wacky as the player's movements could be erratic and unpredictable.

Platformer:
- 1D platformer where movements are based on dice rolls.
- 2D platformer where player is a dice. On each collision with the world the player dice is re-rolled and based on their number certain interactions enable/disable. * 

## Getting Started

Out of my initial ideas I am most excited about doing either:
1. Boggle with dice faces.
2. 2D dice platformer (DiceQuest!)

In terms of scope, I think option 1. is much simpler and has a more clearly defined gameplay mechanic systems. But I am more excited about option 2. -> So thats what we are doing (DICEQUEST!)

## Project Goal

Build a 2D platformer where the player is a dice. On some kind of collision/action the player is re-rolled. When the player is a certain number or certain kind of number this applies some kind of status that changes gameplay or aspects of how the player behaves.
